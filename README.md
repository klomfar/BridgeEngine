# Welcome to the Bridge Engine Beta 5.2!

We're glad to have you onboard. We're committed to enhancing Bridge Engine, so we take all of your feedback and support very earnestly.

Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbkwew3bfWU&list=PLxCu2yuPufWPjCthmZYOOJG9ieRnGAL79" target="_blank">Occipital Youtube Playlist for recent videos on Bridge Engine</a>.  

#### KNOWN ISSUES
- Scanning may stop if optical tracking is lost.
- In some cases doing a Mono Scan and Mono Render mode will lead to rendering SceneKit elements with incorrect occlusion by the real world.
- iOS 11.0 beta does not run mixed reality, VR-only
- Unity 5.6 and GoogleVR 1.40 on iOS does not work well together. Please develop on <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive" target="_blank">Unity 5.5.3f1</a> when using Bridge Engine for Unity package.

#### Beta 5.2: Maintenance Release
- Fixed a case where iOS audio system would stop working, until you plug or unplug headphones.  AudioEngine has been rebuilt to play nice.
- Improved pathfinding performance
- Added Auto Exposure into public release
- Added light map to Bridge Controller model, so you can see it in all light conditions
- Improved stereo scanning UI; tap through (no controller needed) and better instructions

#### Beta 5.1: Stereo Scanning
Keep your iPhone in the Bridge Headset and scan your world by looking around!  In-headset scanning is re-enabled however the feature is still in beta, please give us your feedback.

Also featured in this release:

- Unity 5.5 and GVR 1.4 fixes, picks up the correct GoogleVR release when downloading
- BE For Unity - tracking of reticle works even if no raycasts hit a collider
- Brand new Bridge Controller model, you'll see it in Bridget Sample when one is connected and you look down
- Corrected Bridge controller rotation, works better in all orientations
- Corrected Bridge controller touchpad tracking and state updates, touch.y is +1 for front tip of controller
- Debug setting UI at start of samples, makes for easier record and playback development workflow
- Debug option for manual Bridge controller selection, for crowded environments like hackathons
- Improved pathfinding, respects surfaces above Bridget and what is scanned floor
- Audio Engine init thread safety checks, so iOS 10 audio doesn't stop working

#### Beta 5: Bridge Controller 
Bridge Engine now supports the official controller with 3-DoF rotational tracking, a capacitive touchpad, a trigger & multiple buttons. Additionally, we've loaded the beta with lots of small updates! The BRIDGET sample has improvements to the portal and scan effect; The Unity plugin has matured with a simplified Unity package; We added realistic 3D positional audio support; and you can now record your screen directly from the app using ReplayKit. Note: *Stereo scanning has been temporarly disabled while we address a known issue, but it will be back in the next release.*


#### New in Beta 4: Stereo Scanning 

We have two really exciting updates in Beta 4. The first is stereo scanning, now you can put your Bridge on and build a map directly! Bridgetâ€™s also getting an upgrade! Bridge Engine Beta 4 adds an experimental feature that you may have seen in our videos - a portal into virtual reality. You can can access this new feature immediately to integrate into you own apps for Bridge. Additionally there are a handful of smaller features and updates.

#### Beta 3 Update 1: Bridget sample

We've just released the source of the Bridget sample, based on `OpenBE`, a Bridge Engine open source library containing Bridget's core functions like path planning, animation and scripting, as well as additional UI components, audio, and general mixed reality tools to help you develop with Bridge Engine.

#### New in Beta 3: Bridge Headset Support & Rendering Overhaul
- It turns out we were working on a whole headset to go along with Bridge Engine! Learn more at the [Bridge website](https://bridge.occipital.com)
- Full-resolution rendering - critical for VR
- Forward rendering pipeline. This means compositing onto a global depth buffer with the room geometry, with all SceneKit material controls available like depth testing, rendering order and blending modes.

#### Get Involved
Want to help us expand the capabilities of Bridge Engine? We'd love contributions in the form of pull requests. Soon, we will formalize how to best contribute to Bridge Engine, but feel free to contact us and get involved here on Github.
